Motional Field
-------------------------
A field that represents a collection of velocity vectors of a set of 2D points on 
an image based on the velocity vectors of those points in 3D

Optical flow
-------------------------
A set of velocity vectos of a set 2D points derived from correspondences between two frames
not from 3D points

Is motional Field different from Optical Flow


How to find Optical Flow?
