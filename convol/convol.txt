Convolution neural network 
    - Multiple layer o convolution neural layers
    - The output is fed into activation function 
    - Pooling to decrease noise

Convolution filters are learned 
---------------------------------
    - stochastic gradient descent
    - Usually learn 32 - 512 filters in parallel
